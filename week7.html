        <h2>Week 7: Network Configuration and Management</h2>
        <p> Curriculum Topic: Basic Network Configuration and Management

            Network hardware consists of physical devices that facilitate the communication and management of data within and between networks. These devices play crucial roles in establishing connections, routing data, and ensuring efficient network operations. Understanding network hardware is essential for anyone involved in setting up, managing, or troubleshooting networks.</p>
        <p>1.1. Definition and Importance

            Networking can be defined as the practice of interconnecting multiple computers and devices to enable them to communicate and share resources. This communication can occur over physical connections, such as cables, or wirelessly, using technologies like Wi-Fi. Networking encompasses various types of connections, from simple home networks to complex enterprise and global networks.</p> <br>   
        <p>2.1. Routers

            Routers are devices that route data between different networks. They connect multiple networks, such as a home network to the internet, and manage traffic by directing data packets to their intended destinations. Routers operate at the Network Layer of the OSI Model and use IP addresses to determine the best path for data transmission.</p><br>
        <p>1.2. Types of Networks

            Networking can be categorized into several types based on geographical coverage and usage:
            
            Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN is a network that covers a small geographic area, such as a single building or office. It connects devices within this confined space, allowing them to communicate and share resources. LANs are commonly used in homes, schools, and small businesses.
            
            Wide Area Network (WAN): WANs cover larger geographic areas, connecting multiple LANs across cities, countries, or even continents. The internet is a prime example of a WAN, linking networks worldwide.
            
            Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A MAN spans a city or large campus, providing connectivity within a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. It is used by organizations with multiple locations in a metropolitan area.
            
            Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): WLANs provide wireless connectivity within a limited range, using technologies such as Wi-Fi. They are commonly used in homes and public spaces to offer wireless internet access.</p><br>
        <p>Conclusion

            Networking is a fundamental aspect of modern technology, enabling devices to connect and communicate across various environments. Understanding the basics of networking, including types of networks and networking models, is essential for anyone involved in IT and related fields. This foundational knowledge sets the stage for more advanced topics and practical applications in networking.
